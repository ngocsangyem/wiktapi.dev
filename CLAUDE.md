# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a modern toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, and Oxfmt. Vite+ wraps these tools and package manager commands in a single, global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, but it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`.

## Vite+ Workflow

`vp` is a global binary that handles the full development lifecycle. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

### Install `vp`

```bash
## npm
npm install -g vite-plus

## pnpm
pnpm install -g vite-plus

## yarn
yarn global add vite-plus

#npx
npx vite-plus
```

### Vite+ Commands

- dev - Run the development server
- build - Build for production
- lint - Lint code
- test - Run tests
- fmt - Format code
- lib - Build library
- migrate - Migrate an existing project to Vite+
- new - Create a new monorepo package (in-project) or a new project (global)
- run - Run tasks from `package.json` scripts

These commands map to their corresponding tools. For example, `vp dev --port 3000` runs Vite's dev server and works the same as Vite. `vp test` runs JavaScript tests through the bundled Vitest. The version of all tools can be checked using `vp --version`. This is useful when researching documentation, features, and bugs.

### Package Manager Commands

Vite+ automatically detects and wraps the underlying package manager such as pnpm, npm, or Yarn through the `packageManager` field in `package.json` or package manager-specific lockfiles.

- install - Install all dependencies, or add packages if package names are provided
- add - Add packages to dependencies
- remove - Remove packages from dependencies
- dlx - Execute a package binary without installing it as a dependency
- info - View package information from the registry, including latest versions
- link - Link packages for local development
- outdated - Check for outdated packages
- pm - Forward a command to the package manager
- unlink - Unlink packages
- update - Update packages to their latest versions
- why - Show why a package is installed

## Common Pitfalls

- **Using the package manager directly:** Do not use pnpm, npm, or Yarn directly. Vite+ can handle all package manager operations.
- **Always use Vite commands to run tools:** Don't attempt to run `vp vitest` or `vp oxlint`. They do not exist. Use `vp test` and `vp lint` instead.
- **Running scripts:** Vite+ commands take precedence over `package.json` scripts. If there is a `test` script defined in `scripts` that conflicts with the built-in `vp test` command, run it using `vp run test`.
- **Do not install Vitest, Oxlint, Oxfmt, or tsdown directly:** Vite+ wraps these tools. They must not be installed directly. You cannot upgrade these tools by installing their latest versions. Always use Vite+ commands.
- **Import JavaScript modules from `vite-plus`:** Instead of importing from `vite` or `vitest`, all modules should be imported from the project's `vite-plus` dependency. For example, `import { defineConfig } from 'vite-plus';` or `import { expect, test, vi } from 'vite-plus/test';`. You must not install `vitest` to import test utilities.
- **Type-Aware Linting:** There is no need to install `oxlint-tsgolint`, `vp lint --type-aware` works out of the box.

## Review Checklist for Agents

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp lint`, `vp fmt`, and `vp test` to validate changes.
